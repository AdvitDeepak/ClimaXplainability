    "  ```\n",
    "  > download_raw \n",
    "    > AWI \n",
    "      > 2m_temperature\n",
    "      > 10m_u_component_of_wind \n",
    "    > MPI \n",

    "It should like the above, where within `download_raw`, you have folders representing each climate model (ex. `AWI`, `MPI`). Within each climate models' folder, you have folders representing each variable (ex. `2m_temperature`, `10m_u_component_of_wind`). These variable names can be found at [ClimateLearn's Constants](https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn/blob/main/src/climate_learn/data/processing/era5_constants.py). Finally, within each variable's folder, you can have the downloaded `.nc` files, as long as the start year is in there, and comes before the end year. \n",

    "> NOTE! This script requires that `.nc` files have been split into individual years. If this has not be done, please use the `split_nc.ipynb` script to do so beforehand. \n",
